FinEdge Single-Page Website
This repository contains the code for a website called FinEdge. 
It's a made-up website for a fintech startup that focuses on making international payments easier.

How the Website Was Created
Here's a simple explanation of how the website was designed and built:
Understanding the Requirements: I read the description of FinEdge and figured out what should be included on the website. 
This included things like the navigation bar, sections for home, about, services, and contact, and a form for people to get in touch.
Planning the Structure: I made a plan for how the website should look and what elements it should have.This plan included deciding where 
to put each section and how they should be connected.
Adding Styles with CSS: I created a separate file that contains the styles for the website. This file determines how things 
like text, colors, and spacing should look. It helps make the website look good.

Writing the Content in HTML: I wrote the actual code for the website using a language called HTML. This code defines the structure 
and content of the website. It includes things like headings, paragraphs, and images.

Including Images: I added some temporary images to represent the different services provided by FinEdge. These images can be replaced 
with actual ones that match the services you offer.

Creating a Contact Form: I made a simple form where people can enter their name, email, and a message to get in touch with FinEdge.
However, this form doesn't actually send any messages. To make it work, you would need to add some extra code.

Challenges and Solutions
During the website creation process, I faced a few challenges:
Keeping a Consistent Design: Making sure everything on the website looks good and matches can be tricky. 
To solve this, I made sure to use the same fonts, colors, and spacing throughout the website.
Making the Website Work on Different Devices: People use different devices with different screen sizes to access websites. 
To handle this, I made the website responsive so that it adjusts and looks good on various screen sizes.
Handling Form Submissions: The contact form doesn't actually send any messages because it requires additional code.
To make it work, you would need to add some server-side code or use a service that handles form submissions.
Customizing the Website
If you want to customize the website, here are some things you can do:
Change the text on the website to match the information about your fintech startup.
Replace the temporary images with real ones that represent the services your startup provides.
Adjust the styles in the CSS file to make the website look the way you want.
Add extra functionality to the website using JavaScript, if needed.
Feel free to modify the code and design to suit your needs and preferences.
